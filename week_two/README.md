### Week Two: Probability Spaces

This week we will start learning about probability. We will learn that probabilistic thinking is tricky, because it requires us to think in terms of all possible outcomes, and infintely repeated trials. In order to better get a handle on these infinite horizons, we will use probability spaces, which describe the likelihood of seeing certain outcomes or combinations of outcoms happening. To formalize this, we will learn Sigma notation. Using this notation, we will learn to describe how different probabilities relate to one another, which touches on disjoint, joint, and marginal probabilities.
